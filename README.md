# Testing BottlePy

This basic project features full CRUD functionality based on a simple example. 
It features:
- bottle() -> get, post, redirect, request, route, run, static_file, template
- Template Functions % base / % rebase
- SimpleTemplate syntax
- Inline Expressions
- Embedded Python code
- HTML Forms for GET/POST
- Bulma CSS
- (HTML MetaTags for SEO)

The backend app.py contains a list[] of 'words'. These 'words' can be viewed, added, editted and deleted in the HTML/CSS frontend.
Extra features like Template Functions and Embedded Python code are added for keeping the code clean.
Bulma CSS is added to make it look fancy
